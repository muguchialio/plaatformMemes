              Main algorithm is sorting (Top To Bottom).<br> Content is sorted from the top content to bottom content.
              <br>Sorting is done both to account type, account activity and number of laughs and views per time.
              <br>
              <h3>Sorting</h3>
               <b>Account Type</b><br>
               On my 'Following' list(the people I follow), there are accounts with high user activity and others with lower user activity.<br>
               Posts from Top accounts(with high user activity), are posted on top of my FYP page downwards.
               <br><br><b>Account Activity</b><br>
               It is determined by ottal number of laughs for all posts for the account. If an account has reached a larger audience,
               (determined by Insight tools) it has a higher account activity, hence gets a top position on the FYP Page.<br>
              <br> <b>Laughs(Likes) Per time[LPL]</b><br>
               If a user posts a meme, the algorithm boosts the position of the post on the FYP page of his/her followers with time irregardless of their 
               position placed during posting.
